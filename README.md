Part 2: Monitoring & Observability Stack
Everything you need to monitor your application stack out-of-the-box!

Stack Components
Prometheus: Main metrics collector and time series database.

Node Exporter: System and hardware metrics (CPU, RAM, disk).

Blackbox Exporter: Probe HTTP endpoint health.

Grafana: Dashboard visualizations, auto-provisioned.

Quickstart
Go to Monitoring Directory

text
cd monitoring
Start Monitoring Services

text
docker compose up -d
Access the Web UIs

Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin / admin)

Dashboards & Configuration
Pre-provisioned dashboards for:

Node system metrics (CPU, memory)

Application HTTP health (probe_success)

All dashboards are auto-loaded in Grafana under Dashboards > Manage.

To check or edit configuration:

Prometheus: monitoring/prometheus.yml

Blackbox Exporter: monitoring/blackbox.yml

Grafana dashboards: monitoring/dashboards/

Grafana provisioning: monitoring/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.yml (dashboard loader),
monitoring/provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yml (optional, datasource loader)

ðŸ™‹ FAQ & Help
Where do I run composer? In the root directory after cloning.

Where do I start monitoring? In the /monitoring folder.

Is data source auto-provisioned? Yes, if provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yml is present.

What about secrets? Never commit your filled .env or any real secrets to Git!
